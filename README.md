# StreamElements custom widgets

This is the DEVELOPMENT Repository, it may contain bugs, and is not meant to be used as is.

Feel free to use them, but please credit me if you do so.
I've done them on my free time, and am NOT (really/yet/maybe never) a professional programmer, so it may not be the best code you've ever seen, but it *works*.

Feel free to share any issues you may encounter, I'll try to fix them as soon as I can.  
Feel free to share any ideas you may have, I'll try to implement them as soon as I can.
## Custom Chat boxes
Here you can find some custom chat boxes I've made for StreamElements.
### PrettyChat
__Warning :__ It may still need some work on the even reaction, sometimes it get stuck (I could only test it with SE test tool, not live).
- Dynamic themes
- React to different event of your choice (Subs, Raids, Bits, Donations)  
- You can set custom color for the username
- You can choose to display a background color matched to the theme
- You can chose to display or not every element of the message (username, event, amount) but the message itself.
- You can set custom icons for the different roles (broadcaster, mod, sub, vip, regular).
- Chose accounts to not be displayed (ex. bots)
- Chose to display or not command messages (ex. !so, !discord, !uptime, etc.)

## Donation Counter
This is a donation counter, donation counters i've made
### With check
- It reacts to everything so you can compatibilise donation, bits, subs. You can set the ration of the event for your currency (ex. set 1 sub = 2.5 usd).
- 5 dynamic goals you can set (text and amount), once you reach a certain amount the box get checked.
- Automatic detection of your currency, so it displays it accordingly. 
- Dynamic themes
- Doesn't forget the amount raised if you edit it, unless you reset it.
- Ability to offset the starting point (useful if you reset by mistake the counter).
